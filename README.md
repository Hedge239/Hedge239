# Hi, I am Hedge.

I am a new english developer, I am attempting to learn german, and I focus mostly between Linux and Windows. I use any programs that work.

## What I like to do

I like to develop alot of things. Programs for games, games themself, and some other programs.

I uselly only do program development when I am traveling or have no clue on what to do. Otherwise you can expect me to mostly be working on games made on the unity engine.

## Codeing Languages I use
I know Java and a little at C++ but I do know C# for unity game development
