# Hi, I am Hedge.

I am a new english developer, I am attempting to learn german, and I focus mostly between Linux and Windows. I use any programs that work.

## What codeing languages do I know

I only know a few codeing languages, they are **C#, C++.** I am more focused on C++ then C#.
  I know codeing languages such as Java or Python very little, but just enough for modding or small changes.
  
## Other

I mainly focus on games, but I do also make other programs as I practice. Most of my programs will be Open Source. The programs that are not are because I stuck by some licenseing agreement, or I just don't feel like opening my code.
