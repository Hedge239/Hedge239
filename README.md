# Hi, I am Hedge.

I am a new developer, developing between Linux and Windows.

I primarily know C# and C++, but I know a few other languages a little when needed.

I depend mostly on Visual Studio Code for my main development and UE4 for my game development, but I may use other things for codeing when needed.
