# Hi, I am Hedge.

I am a new english developer, I am attempting to learn german, and I focus mostly between Linux and Windows. I use any programs that work.

## What codeing languages do I know

I only know a few codeing languages, my primary is **C++.**.
  I know codeing languages such as Java or Python very little, but just enough for modding or small changes.
    Most of my 3D games are made with Unreal, my 2D games are split between Unreal and no game engine, the games made with out a game engine are simple but still fun
      games that are mostly for pratice.
  
## Other

I mainly focus on games, but I do also make other programs as I practice. Most of my programs will be Open Source. The programs that are not are because I stuck by some licenseing agreement, or I just don't feel like opening my code.
