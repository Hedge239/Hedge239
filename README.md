# Hi, I am Hedge.

I am a new developer, developing between Linux and Windows.

## What codeing languages do I know

I only know a few codeing languages, they are **C#, C++.** I am more focused on C++ then C#.
  I know codeing languages such as Java or Python very little, but just enough for modding or small changes.
